<!--
Semantic tags in HTML5 are used to describe the meaning or purpose of the element to both the browser and the user. This is in comparison to <div> containers which are mainly used for labeling areas within the page for styling but do not convey any particular formatting information themselves. All of the semantic tags seem to have their own purpose, so far I've seen the table and form elements as most useful.

The browser takes these steps to display the elements on the page: The DOM (Document Object Model) is formed from the HTML that is received from the server. Then styles are loaded and parsed, forming the CSS Object Model. Then a rendering tree is created with lists a set of objects to be rendered. For each tree element, its coordinates are calculated. This process is called 'layout'. Then the page is actually displayed, known as 'painting'.

I learned that I can make my own sublime snippets to create shortcuts to processes I use frequently, which will save me a lot of time int he long run. I will make some for creating tables and lists in the future.

I got hung up on wrapping my head around when a table element has a rowspan="2" that it will be represented as a vertical column. But by testing it out in practice I was able to see it clearly.

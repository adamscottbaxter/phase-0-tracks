## What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

> One key design philosophy of Linux is that it assumes the user is knowledgeable enough to get given full control of the OS, allowing them to do anything, including make mistakes. This is in contrast to Windows which limits the user's abilities to do mostly what the OS developers expect them to do. Another design philosophy is that the (what I would call) methods or programs are compact and efficient in doing a focused task, avoiding the allure of being a swiss army knife, and instead do one job really well.

## In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

> A VPS is usually a remote partition or allocation of memory on a larger machine or network of machines that is being sold out in smaller units to customers who would like to have a server run continually without the maintenance or start up cost. Aside from maintenance and up front costs, VSP's are also more 'disposable' in the sense that if something goes terribly wrong the losses are minimal.

## Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

> It can be bad practice to operate as the root user because you could make a large mistake such as deleting something important. It also makes the computer easier to hack since all of the applications are running with root privileges. Finally, root is not needed in many cases where the 'sudo' command could be used instead.

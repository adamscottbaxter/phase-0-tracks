1. First I plan on getting a broad overview of what jquery is and what it can do. Probably googling some general definitions and purposes.

2. I will look around for project ideas to get a better scope of what I can do once I learn a little jquery.

3. Then I will devise a practice project that I can implement in a two hour time frame. I can pseudocode my ideas, then do some specific searches when I get stuck.

* I like to learn by doing, but the releases seem to focus on mostly 'passive' research. I think I'm going to go ahead and use my research time to build something.

Well, coming back to this, it took me  a lot longer to get the gist of jquery than I thought. I ended up reading for a while. I did devise my own plan and implement it as I had imagined, which was satisfying, but I definitely went over time. I'm ok with that since it worked out as I was hoping. Probably not perfect, could loop or refactor, but pretty good for a first go.
